/**
 * Paints control the appearance of mesh surfaces.
 *
 * <p>Paints are complex objects with serialization space
 * requirements large enough to require special handling
 * when used in abundance.
 *
 * <p>To manage this challenge, paints have three types of
 * visibility that are meant to be mutually exclusive:
 *
 * <p><em>Anonymous Paints</em>: Paints instances returned by PaintFinder
 * are interned but have no identity or persistence on their own.  They can be
 * serialized/de-serialized using the methods provided on this interface.
 *
 * <p><em>Registered Paints</em>: Paints that are registered are distinct
 * from anonymous instances returned by PaintFinder and can be created
 * and retrieved with the Paint Registry.  These paints are ideal
 * for mods with fixed mesh and paint configurations where can paints
 * can be retrieved and applied in initialization and never need to be
 * serialized.
 *
 * <p><em>Indexed Paints</em>: With PaintInddex, an anonymous paint can associated with an immutable
 * numeric index at run time.  The association is persisted with the world
 * and can be serialized and later used to reconstruct an anonymous paint
 * instance from the numeric instance.  The paint associated with an index
 * can also be changed or removed. These dynamically registered paints are
 * meant for mods that create new paints at run time and  need compact serialization.
