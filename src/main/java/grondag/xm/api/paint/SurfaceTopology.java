	/**
	 * Quad is part of a continuous surface. A UV distance of 1 should approximate 1
	 * in-world block width.
	 *
	 * <p>UV coordinates should be kept positive for simplicity but can be in any
	 * range. If any coordinate exceeds the size of the selected texture, the
	 * painter will subdivide the quad to allow tiling and will also use the
	 * coordinate information to randomize tiling and texture selection. This
	 * prevent visible repetition on larger models and also means the mesh generator
	 * doesn't have to consider texture tiling for textures that are smaller than
	 * the whole surface - the painter will handle it.
	 *
	 * <p>If the surface wraps in any dimension, then periodicity should be
	 * communicated in {@link SurfaceInstance#uvWrapDistance}. If that value is
	 * non-zero, the painter will scale and tile textures to the closest
	 * approximation of 1:1 UV to world scale. If the surface wraps in both
	 * dimensions (toroids should be the only ones that do this) then the smallest
	 * wrapping dimension should govern and to avoid seams the longer dimension
	 * should wrap at a multiple of the smaller.
	 *
	 * <p>Some surface topologies need to wrap at edges but don't map to a square
	 * texture - icosahedrons and cubic spheres, for example. For these, break the
	 * model into quads that should connect and then emit (possibly subdivided)
	 * quads with a wrap distance that is the same as the maxUV values used for each
	 * face. For best results, use textures that can wrap in rotation. Some bigTex
	 * textures won't join perfectly, but it's the best that can be done.
	 *
	 * <p>Unlike a cubic surface, in-world position can't be used for face
	 * randomization within the model. As mentioned before, for surfaces large
	 * enough to tile with a given texture, the painter will using tiling position
	 * as data for randomization. The painter will also use texture salt (specified
	 * in the surface instance) and nominal face (if provided) to drive texture
	 * randomization. These last two are useful for smaller models that have to wrap
	 * the same texture within a small visible region. (The painter <em>may</em> use
	 * in-world origin position or other in-world information to randomize the whole
	 * texturing process, but this does not provide variation of faces within the
	 * model.)
	 *
	 * <p>Example 1: A cubic sphere of one block diameter has a UVwrap of ~1 with
	 * nominal faces assigned to quads. All quads will have UV min of 0 and max
	 * equal to the wrap distance. The quad painter will scale/tile the selected
	 * texture to fit within the wrap distance span. Big textures will appear small
	 * but will wrap correctly. Nominal face will be used to prevent visual
	 * repetition.
	 *
	 * <p>Example 2: A single-texture cylinder of radius 1 and length 10 will have a
	 * UVwrap distance ~6.2 because the texture must wrap on the circular surface
	 * and the approximate circumference will be ~6.2. The cylinder is longer than 8
	 * in the lengthwise dimension, so UV coordinate outside of 0-6.2 will be used
	 * in that dimension, giving the painter information it can use to avoid
	 * repetition along the length. Quads on the cylinder ends will use the same UV
	 * scale so that textures appear similar, but do not need to wrap or join with
	 * the lengthwise surface. If a 1x1, 2x2 or texture is selected, it will be
	 * tiled within the surface by subdivision. 4x4 will probably be zoomed to fill
	 * 6.2 vs. tiling.. An 8x8 texture will wrap around the cylinder exactly once at
	 * something close to the intended visual scale and larger textures will be
	 * scaled down to wrap exactly once.
