/**
 * Implement to define when a block neighbor should be considered "present and
 * matching" for purposes of computing a join state. Can also be used for more
 * general purposes to retrieve values with caching and lazy evaluation via
 * {@link BlockNeighbors#result(grondag.xm2.connect.api.model.BlockCorner)} and
 * its variance.
 *
 * <p>The "from" values will always be derived from the central block. The "to"
 * values will represent a neighboring block. All inputs benefit from the lazy
 * evaluation and caching provided by {@link BlockNeighbors}.
 *
 * <p>The model state values will be non-null if {@link BlockNeighbors} was given a
 * state function when it was retrieved. (And if the function returns a non-null
 * value.) See {@link ModelStateFunction}
